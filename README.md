# Accessible Power BI Report – Adventure Works

## 🧠 Objective
Enhance accessibility features in a Power BI report using:
- Descriptive titles
- Alt text for visuals
- Chart markers
- High-contrast themes
- Proper tab order navigation

## 📈 Accessibility Improvements Made
- **Descriptive Titles**: All charts were renamed for clarity
- **Alt Text**: Each visual includes meaningful alternative text
- **Markers**: Line charts now use unique markers for each region
